The situation in Poland continues to deteriorate. Polish government attacks on all aspects of democracy,
civil liberties, human rights and the rule of law continues to escalate.

The numbers of independently confirmed and still to be confirmed cases of government overreach
is continually increasing across all parts of Poland. 


Because of incredibly large number of those incidents, and its constant growth it is impossible
to keep track of them all therefore it is difficult to recognise the scale of governmental overreach. 


This repository is the beginning of a "mapping project" (online web-application). 

Once completed, citizens, witnesses and anyone affected
by the governmental overreach will be able to submit information about those incidents
by providing relevant details/descriptions of the incidents, dates, location/s, supporting materials, video,
images, and whenever there was a court ruling afterwards.

This data will then be verified by independent journalists 
and will then be placed on an interactive/visual map of 
Poland for public access.

This is to enable visualisation of the overall scale of those incidents, that have happened, and are happening across Poland.
