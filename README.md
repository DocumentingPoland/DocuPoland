The situation in Poland continues to deteriorate. Polish government attacks on all aspects of democracy,
civil liberties, human rights and the rule of law continues to escalate.

The numbers of independently confirmed and still to be confirmed cases of government overreach
is continually increasing across all parts of Poland. 


Because of incredibly large number of those incidents, and its constant growth it is impossible
to keep track of them all therefore it is difficult to recognise the scale of governmental overreach. 


This repository is the beginning of a "mapping project" web-app. 

Once completed, citizens and everyone affected (and witnesses)
by the governmental overreach will be able to submit (via online web-app) information about those cases
by providing relevant details/description of the incidents, dates, location of incident/s, supporting materials, video,
images, and whenever there was a court ruling afterwards.

This data will then be verified by independent journalists 
and will then be placed on an interactive/visual map of 
Poland for public access.

This is to enable everyone to visualize the scale of all of those incidents, that have happened, and are happening across Poland.



---- Developers----

The web app is being developed using .net core (5.0.3) API, and Angular (typescript) front end.

If you believe in the ideas behind this project and feel like you could contribute 
(especially on UI/front end side) please get in touch: documentingpoland@protonmail.com
